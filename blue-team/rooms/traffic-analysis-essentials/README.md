# 🛡️ TryHackMe – Traffic Analysis Essentials

> **Room:** [Traffic Analysis Essentials](https://tryhackme.com/room/trafficanalysisessentials)  
> **Path:** SOC Level 1  
> **Status:** ✅ *In Progress*  
> **Tags:** `#tryhackme` `#soc-path` `#traffic-analysis` `#pcap` `#wireshark` `#zeek` `#snort` `#vault-worthy`

## 🧠 Overview

This room introduces the fundamentals of **network traffic analysis** using packet captures (PCAP files), intrusion detection systems (IDS), and core protocols (TCP, HTTP, DNS, ARP). It’s designed to simulate what a **SOC Tier 1 Analyst** might do when triaging suspicious network activity.

## 🧰 Tools Used

| Tool       | Purpose                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Wireshark  | PCAP inspection and packet filtering |
| Zeek       | High-level traffic analysis          |
| tcpdump    | Command-line capture/filtering       |
| Snort      | Signature-based IDS analysis         |

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand common network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, ARP)
- Identify malicious traffic in packet captures
- Analyze Snort rules and IDS alerts
- Apply basic detection techniques used in SOC environments

## 📝 Walkthrough

See [`walkthrough.md`](./walkthrough.md) for task-by-task notes and flags.
